# SimpleSpeaks



Simple Speaks is an app dedicated to those who have difficulty talking because of their speech impediment. Although there are a variety of speech impediments, they all make having casual conversations stressful and can even mess up critical moments such as presentations, interviews, or even meeting new people. Simple Speaks was created to help people overcome these issues and increase their confidence in speaking. Through this app, you can practice by pronouncing randomly generated sentences as well as sentences starting with a specific letter to hone down on your specific speech impediment. Simple Speaks also allows you to add your own custom sentences and shuffle them for practice. To support overcoming speech impediments, Simple Speaks has a daily reminder notification to practice speaking.
